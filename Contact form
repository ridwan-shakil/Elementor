==========================
Essential addons
Elements kit,

==========================
Contact form not sending email/ Email going to spam :
==========================
default phy mail system may work but it will go into the spam folder
So we have to use a dedicated Email-sending system 
Most of the hosting provides a "Business Email" creation option and lets you send emails 
But if your hosting doesn't provide that 
You have to use a SMTP Mailer
Zoohoo provides it at a cheap price 
 "Brevo" lets you send 300 emails per day for free!!!

----------------------
Free solution = Brevo SMTP server setup
----------------------
WP Form -> SMTP -> setup SMTP- > Select "Brevo" server 
brevo.com -> create an account -> top right corner click -> SMTP & API -> API key -> create an API key -> Copy the key 
pest the API key in your admin panel -> smtp-> API key

it may take some time to work properly

==========================
Show form entries in the admin panel & show entries on any page
==========================
